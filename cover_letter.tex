\opening{To whom it may concern,} 

I'm writing to express my interest in the Machine Learning-Software Engineer/Scientist that is posted on the website.
I believe my interdisciplinary skills and experience for the hardware and software framework would be valuable to 
Brain Corp, and make me an ideal fit for this position.

I have been working on deep neural network with TensorFlow since Nov. 2016, especially for
the computer vision using CNN.  For the classification, I implemented the AlexNet with TensorFlow from the scratch
and achieved ~51\% validation accuracy to know well the details about CNN.  Also, I devised the tutorial that
guides the students to understand the foundation of deep learning through classifying Cifat-10 dataset.
Now, I focus on deep learning on embedded systems that can perform real-time applications.
I devised a CNN model with end-to-end training for single object detection in real-time on NVIDIA
Jetson TX2 embedded systems ($>$ 20 FPS and 65\% IoU for 98 classes).

You will see after reviewing the enclosed resume.  I have made numerous contributions to my advisers
and employers, especially the parts of the implementations.  Due to the rise of deep learning applications, 
I believe the implementations of deep neural network onto the embedded systems is going to play the critical role and
I am ready for its coming. 

I am confident that I am qualified for this position. Thank you for your time -- I look forward to learning more about this opportunity!

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
